the idea is to create a path big enough to overflow the output file so that the input file path will be over written by user input
then, the last part of the big path will be a valid file path that will be a symbolic link to the actual file to read from
/tmp/cc/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/tmp/cc/output3
